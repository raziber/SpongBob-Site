        <h2><u>Who is SpongeBob SquarePants?</u></h2>
        SpongeBob SquarePants is a yellow sponge who wears square pants, thus the name. He lives in a pineapple at 124 Conch Street with his pet snail, Gary, in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom.
        He loves his job as a fry cook at The Krusty Krab, where the specialty is Krabby Patties, and is very good at his job. He has won employee of the month more than 300 times. While at work his uniform includes a tall, white hat with a small blue anchor.
        SpongeBob is not particularly bright and tends to annoy those around him, particularly his next door neighbor and coworker, Squidward Tentacles. The residents of Bikini Bottom once held a "National No SpongeBob Day," which SpongeBob misinterpreted as an honor, eve thought they burned him in effigy.
        SpongeBob is goofy and fun-loving. He is also very determined and can become fixated on a task. His confidence does not match his ability; he is much more of the former than the latter. He is kind, gullible and easily frightened. He is easily manipulated by Squidward, Mr. Krabs and Plankton, in his many disguises.
        When he is frustrated SpongeBob can be sarcastic and rude.
        His best friends are Patrick Star, who lives under a rock, and a squirrel from Texas named Sandy Cheeks, who wears a suit and helmet to survive underwater.
        Spongebob is a rarely-depressed and happy sponge who feels no hatred for anybody. He and Patrick fall into many silly adventures that lead to them to trouble.
        Background: In addition to his squarepants, SpongeBob also wears ankle socks, shiny black leather shoes and a short-sleeved white shirt and red tie -- all of which are referred to as his pants. He has blue eyes with three eyelashes on each one, and bright blue eyes and two big buck teeth. He is 4 inches tall. He occasionally strips down to nothing. Although he is a sea sponge, he is shaped like a kitchen sponge.
        He has failed the test for his Boating License at Mrs. Puff's Boating School every time he has taken it, often nearly killing Mrs. Puff in the process. He is afraid of the dark and clowns. Because he is a boneless sponge, he is capable of changing shape and absorbing impacts. He can regenerate parts of his body. When he cries, he absorbs his own tears. He is skilled at Demolition Derbies, jellyfishing (catching jellyfish in nets) and at bubble blowing.
        His driver's license says he was born July 14, 1986, making him 13 at the time of his premiere.
